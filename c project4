Loops in c #43

What is loop?
--Loop is a statement which repeat a given task a given amount of time
Ex. printing name of the screen, counting 1-100, find even number between 1-100

Why do we use loop?
--In programming we always have some repetitive tasks. To reduce repetitive code we use loop
Ex. We have a student database and we want them to send a notice. If we want it to be done manually it will become near to impossible.

Type of loops on c
--For loops(follow step)
--While loops (Follow condition)
--Do while loop(Follow condition but execute at least once)
